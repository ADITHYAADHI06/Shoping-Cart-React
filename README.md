The goal of this project is to develop a shopping cart application using React Core Hooks, specifically useContext and useReducer. The application will allow users to browse products, add them to their cart, update quantities, and complete their purchase.

Key Features:
1. Product Listing: The application will display a list of products, including their name, image, price, and availability.
2. Shopping Cart: Users will have a shopping cart where they can add, remove, and update the quantity of items they want to purchase.
3. Cart Total: The application will calculate and display the total cost of the items in the shopping cart.
4. Checkout Process: Users will have the option to proceed to the checkout process, where they can provide their billing and shipping information.
5. State Management with useContext and useReducer: The useContext hook will be used to provide the shopping cart state to components, and the useReducer hook will handle state updates and actions.
6. Responsive Design: The application will be responsive and accessible, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies and Tools:
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Core Hooks: Specifically, useContext and useReducer will be utilized for state management and context sharing between components.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring the user interface and styling the application.
- npm: The package manager for managing project dependencies.
